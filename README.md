Welcome to my Github site. I developed many repositories of challenges and websites. The short film digital press kits are located in my account. 

I started to complete the Front End Mentor challenges in the summer of 2022 to enhance my front end skills. It provided plenty of JavaScript skills.

Feel free to follow and ask any questions of repositories.

Also I would love to contribute any non-profit organizations.
